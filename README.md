# Basic-python-problems

Following Repository covers basic problems in Python and their logic explained.

1.Write a function that returns the letter grade based on an input number grade. This is a simple if statement.  If x is greater than or equal to 90 return A and so on.  Write the function and demonstrate that it works with by running it.  Add assert statement after your demonstration to show how you can test something.

2.Take generic input with the input command. Use an if statement to write a function that returns “Lamar is a great school” if the sentence passed has the word Lamar. 

3.Sum the numbers from 1 to 100 using a loop and the range statement.

4.Sort a list of numbers using the sort function and by code that you write yourself. Please do a simple selection sort. 
b. Find the minimum item on the original list and move to position 1. Repeat this until the list is sorted.This algorithm is not effluent but is good for teaching.  If you can do this task you understand python lists and loops.  No need to place in a function.  Test on an example at least 5 integers in a list. 

5.Write a command line number guessing game.  Get user input on a number.  Give the person a hit on the number (higher or lower).  Make the maximum number be the first input to the program.

6.Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere when passed the radius.  Use an assert statement to test the function.

7.Use the print statement to write your initials of your name to the screen using * symbol.  Make a large string with line breaks. 

8.Write a function that computes the average of numbers input by the user and displays the average, minimum, maximum and the numbers in a nice format (using print statement).

9.Write a function that take a upper limit as a parameter and returns a list of prime numbers. Put it in a module and use the function to generate all the prime number less than 200.

10.Find the greatest common divisor between two numbers.  Write a function.  Make sure to put error checking in the function.  Both numbers must be positive integers for the function to work.
